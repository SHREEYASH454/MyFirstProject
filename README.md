#Character Display of the anime JoJo's Bizarre Adventure
This project is a fun and interactive showcase of the main characters from **JoJo's Bizarre Adventure**, featuring an immersive experience with images, audio, and typewriter text effects.

  - Play a corresponding audio clip.
  - Display a description of the character in a typewriter text effect.
  - Move the clicked image to the front and hide others.
- **Smooth Animations**: Images expand on hover, and transitions happen when switching between images.
- **Background Color Change**: When a character is selected, the background color changes for a more immersive experience.
- **Audio Control**: Only one audio clip plays at a time. Click outside the image to reset everything.
- **Typewriter Effect**: Descriptions of characters are shown in a typewriter style with a blinking cursor.

## Technologies Used
